#Couchbase with Azure ARM Templates
This blog post describes how to set up your own Couchbase Cluster using Azure Resource Manager templates, aka ARM templates.

##Prerequisites: 
This post is describing how to host your own Couchbase Cluster in Microsoft Azure. If you would like to try this you will need a few things:

1. Azure Subscription, sign-up here for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial).
2. Azure CLI, installed on your system, [how to install](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/xplat-cli-install/). 
3. [Github Account](https://github.com/), optional if you would like to experiment with your own ARM templates.

##What you will deploy
This blog post will walk you through the steps needed to deploy your own Couchbase 4.1 Cluster in Microsoft Azure. The size of the cluster is configurable but will as a minimum consist of a three node cluster set-up with replication to one node. You can also chose the data center location for Cluster between all available locations assessable with your Microsoft Azure subscription.   

In the process of deploying Couchbase to Azure you will learn about Azure Resource Manager Templates and how to edit them to fit your needs. This will allow you to change default values in the Couchbase ARM template but also understand how to use ARM templates in other cases when using Microsoft Azure.

##Azure Resource Manager templates
Azure Resource Manager allows you to provision applications to Microsoft Azure using a declarative template. With a single single template, you can deploy multiple services along with their dependencies. You also have the option to split up your ARM templates into multiple templates that each describe individual resources. You can use the same templates individually or separately to repeatedly deploy your application/resources during every stage of the application lifecycle.

You can compare ARM templates to other resource description technologies like [chef.io](https://docs.chef.io/resource_template.html) or others.

Here is an example of the most simple ARM template:

```
{
   "$schema": "http://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
   "contentVersion": "",
   "parameters": {  },
   "variables": {  },
   "resources": [  ],
   "outputs": {  }
}
``` 

ARM templates are written in JSON with the option to use some special formatted strings that can work as references to variables and/or method calls. 

The ARM template snippet below shows how to define a virtual network and the use of `variables` and `parameters` in an ARM template.

```
{
      "apiVersion": "2015-05-01-preview",
      "type": "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks",
      "name": "[variables('virtualNetworkName')]",
      "location": "[variables('location')]",
      "properties": {
        "addressSpace": {
          "addressPrefixes": [
            "[variables('addressPrefix')]"
          ]
        },
        "subnets": [
          {
            "name": "[variables('subnetName')]",
            "properties": {
              "addressPrefix": "[variables('subnetPrefix')]"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    },
```

You can read more about how to author ARM templates from the Microsoft [Azure documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-authoring-templates/). 

It also possible to execute external code like shell scripts etc. to allow for custom configuration, installation directly on a Virtual Machine as part of the set-up process.

In combination all this allows for a very fine grained configuration and set-up of resources in Azure. 
The above ARM template snippet is taken from the [Couchbase Cluster ARM template](https://github.com/martinesmann/couchbase-azure/tree/master/src/templates) on GitHub. 

The option to execute scripts on the VM is used to install and configure Couchbase Server on each individual VM and then lastly set-up the Couchbase Cluster between the individual Couchbase nodes. 

```
 "vmScripts": {
      "scriptsToDownload": [
        "[concat(variables('templateBaseUrl'), 'couchbase-azure-install.sh')]",
        "[concat(parameters('cbPackageDownloadBase'), parameters('cbPackage'))]",
        "[concat(variables('templateBaseUrl'), 'vm-disk-utils-0.1.sh')]"
      ],
      "installCommand": "[concat('bash couchbase-azure-install.sh -d ', parameters('cbPackage'), ' -n ', parameters('clusterName'), ' -i ', concat(variables('networkSettings').nodesIpPrefix, '-', variables('clusterSpec').clusterSize), ' -a ', variables('machineSettings').adminUsername, ' -p ', variables('machineSettings').adminPassword, ' -r ', variables('clusterSpec').couchbaseRamQuota)]",
      "setupCommand": "[concat('bash couchbase-azure-install.sh -d ', parameters('cbPackage'), ' -n ', parameters('clusterName'), ' -i ', concat(variables('networkSettings').nodesIpPrefix, '-', variables('clusterSpec').clusterSize), ' -a ', variables('machineSettings').adminUsername, ' -p ', variables('machineSettings').adminPassword, ' -r ', variables('clusterSpec').couchbaseRamQuota, ' -l')]"
    },
    "clusterSpec": "[variables(concat('tshirtSize', parameters('tshirtSize')))]"
``` 

The above snippet shows how to configure an external script as part of the ARM template and passing in command line arguments, using `parameters`.

We will talk more about ARM templates later.   

##Azure CLI
In the previous section we briefly learned about ARM templates and how they can be used to describe resources in Azure. A recipe for the resources and there individual configurations as need for your specific set-up.

In this section we we focus on how to use the ARM template or in Azure jargon, Deploy ARM templates. You have a few deployment options, let's briefly walk through them.

###Using Azure Portal, option 1
The new Azure portal give you an option to do "template deployment" from within the portal itself. 
By navigating to: [Microsoft.Template](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template)
you can copy/paste you ARM template into the portal and execute it. The UI even support custom parameters etc.

The drawback is that you can only copy/paste one ARM template into the portal and all resources need to be with this single "file".

###Using Azure Portal, option 2
This feature is very close to "option 1" but with a few differences. It's possible to instruct Azure to download an ARM template from an external source, only requirement is that all resources (templatesÂ´, scritps etc.) are publicly available.

This feature can be seen and tested from the Microsoft Official Azure Quick Start Templates repository on GitHub, [azure-quickstart-templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/)

If you visit this specific template[101-vm-simple-windows](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-vm-simple-windows) you will see a blue button (Deploy to Azure). Pushing this button will redirect you to the Azure Portal Template Deployment, but now with the template pre-pasted into the portal.

>Note! 
>
>The [azure-quickstart-templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/) is a great resource for learning more about ARM templates.

###Azure PowerShell 
Azure PowerShell is a module for PowerShell that gives you access to execute commands agains Azure from PowerShell. You can create, test, deploy, and manage solutions and services incl ARM template deployments.

PowerShell is a great command line tool for the Windows Platform and widely used by both IT Professionals and Developers, but it's only available on Windows. 

Read more [PowerShell](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/powershell-azure-resource-manager/)

But not everyone run Windows! That's why Microsoft has developed the Azure CLI tool.

###Azure CLI     
The Azure CLI is a command line tool for working with Microsoft Azure; build for Mac, Linux, and Windows. 
Working with a x-platform tool like Azure CLI give you the great benefit that you can use your knowlagde on all platforms.

I have chosen to use Azure CLI as it seems to have the wides audience and can be used on most platforms.

The rest of this post will assume the use of the Azure CLI, but many (if not all) commands also exists in Azure PowerShell.

###Install Azure CLI
Depending on you preferences you can install Azure CLI from a dedicated install or using `npm`

###Authentication
Before using the Azure CLI we need to authenticate against Microsoft Azure. There are multiple ways to authenticate the CLI with Azure, for a detailed guide visit [Connect to an Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/xplat-cli-connect/).

In this guide we will use this command:

```
azure login
```

*Please follow the on screen instructions to authenticate the Azure CLI.*

###Set Azure Subscription Account to use
If you have multiple Azure Subscriptions you need to select the subscription to use.

Use this command to liste the available subscriptions for the account: 

```
azure account list
```

Set the subscription you would like to use as your `default` account for all instances of the Azure CLI instance. 
```
azure account set "Azure Pass" 
```

###Set the Azure Resource Manager mode
The Azure Resource Manager mode is not enabled by default, use the following command to enable Azure CLI Resource Manager commands.

```
azure config mode arm
```

###Create a Resource Group
```
azure group create -n CB_RESOURCE_GROUP -l "Eest US"
```
###Create a deployment and wait for success

```
azure group deployment create \
	--template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martinesmann/couchbase-azure/master/src/templates/azuredeploy.json \
    -e templates/azuredeploy.parameters.json \
    CB_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    AZURE_DEPLOYMENT
```
###Public IP for Resource Group
```
azure network public-ip list CB_RESOURCE_GROUP
```
